This project was completed to fulfil the requirements of the course MAE263E - Bionics System Design at UCLA. 
The purpose of this projects is to develop a bionic device aimed at restoring a natural walking pattern for patients experiencing Achilles tendon stiffness while also compensating for weakness in the calf muscles. Stiffened Archilles tendon can cause pain and discomfort during walking. Through biomechanical modeling using OpenSims, specifications of a bionic device was developed which can supplement plantarflexion, reducing the force requirement for muscles like GAS and SOL, in turn taking off load from the stiffened tendon. The bionic system will supplement plantarflexion, reducing the force requirement for Gastro and Soleus in turn taking off load from stiffened tendon. Biomechanical modeling yielded torque requirement for different stage of a normal gait cycle, which formed the basis of motor and transmission selection of the bionic system. Next, motor and transmission system were optimized to yield lowest energy lost to heat using simulations performed in MATLAB. The current and voltage requirement derived from this assessment were used to finalized the battery, transmission design and concept design.

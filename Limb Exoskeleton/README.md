This project was undertaken to fulfill the requirements of the course MAE263E - Bionics System Design at UCLA. The goal was to develop a bionic device aimed at restoring a natural walking pattern for patients experiencing Achilles tendon stiffness, while also compensating for calf muscle weakness. Stiffened Achilles tendons can cause significant pain and discomfort during walking.

Using biomechanical modeling in OpenSim, the project defined the specifications for a bionic device capable of supplementing plantarflexion. By reducing the force demands on muscles such as the Gastrocnemius (GAS) and Soleus (SOL), the device alleviates stress on the stiffened tendon. The biomechanical modeling provided the torque requirements across different stages of a normal gait cycle, forming the foundation for selecting the motor and transmission system of the device.

Subsequently, the motor and transmission system were optimized using MATLAB simulations to minimize energy lost as heat. The results of these simulations guided the selection of the motor, transmission design, and battery. Ultimately, these assessments informed the final concept design of the bionic system, ensuring both functional and energy-efficient performance.

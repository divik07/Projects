# Project Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases a diverse collection of engineering and robotics projects, highlighting my expertise in mechanical design, control systems, and dynamic simulations. Each project combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, offering innovative solutions to real-world challenges. Below is a brief overview of the projects included:

### Projects:

1. **Limb Exoskeleton**  
   Developed as part of the MAE263E - Bionics System Design course at UCLA, this project aims to restore a natural walking pattern for patients with Achilles tendon stiffness and calf muscle weakness. Using biomechanical modeling in OpenSim, torque requirements for a bionic device were defined, optimizing motor and transmission systems via MATLAB simulations to ensure energy-efficient performance and minimize heat loss.

2. **3D Y-Catapult Simulation**  
   Designed and analyzed a 3D Y-shaped catapult system, focusing on energy conservation and elastic beam mechanics. The model calculates optimal release angles for projectile motion by simulating bending and stretching forces in interconnected beams and elastic strings. The energy-based approach ensures the system adheres to principles of energy conservation.

3. **Chopping Robot (CHOPP)**  
   Created as part of the MAE263C - Controls of Robotic Systems course at UCLA, this four-DOF robotic manipulator aids in food preparation by cutting produce with a knife as its end effector. The system demonstrates decentralized PID control and trajectory generation to slice and organize food like hard-boiled eggs and bananas in a home setting.

4. **5-DOF Robotic Manipulator Arm (SQUARE)**  
   Designed for the MAE263A - Kinematics of Robotic Systems course at UCLA, this project features a 5-DOF robotic manipulator, SQUARE, built to recreate the viral video “It Goes in the Square Hole!”. The arm precisely manipulates and places blocks into a square hole, showcasing custom gripper design, advanced control algorithms, and robust construction for both functional and entertainment purposes.

Feel free to explore the repository for the design files, source code, and documentation detailing the development process of each project.

This project was completed to fulfil the requirements of the course MAE263A - Kinematics of Robotic Systems.

This project demonstrates the design and development of a 5-DoF robotic manipulator, SQUARE (Superior Quick Utility Arm Replicating Entertainment). The goal was to recreate the viral internet video “It Goes in the Square Hole!”, where a robotic pick-and-place arm humorously places blocks of various shapes into a square hole, regardless of their designated repository.

The robotic manipulator was meticulously designed, programmed, and manufactured to perform this task with precision and entertainment value. The key features of SQUARE include:

1. 5 Degrees of Freedom (DoF): Ensuring versatile movement and manipulation of objects.
2. Custom Gripper Design: Capable of securely handling blocks of varying shapes and sizes.
3. Programmed Precision: Advanced control algorithms to pick, place, and (intentionally) misplace objects.
4. Manufactured Accuracy: Designed and built with robust materials for consistent performance.

Feel free to explore the repository for the design files, source code, and documentation detailing the development process.
